## Introduction

This application is built using the MERN stack, which is a popular combination of technologies for building full-stack web applications. The MERN stack consists of:
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for storing data.
- **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js.
- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Node.js**: A runtime environment for executing JavaScript code server-side.

### Why MERN?

The MERN stack is chosen for its flexibility, scalability, and ease of use in developing modern web applications. It allows developers to work with JavaScript across the entire application stack, which can streamline development and maintenance.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:
  - React.js
  - HTML/CSS

- **Backend**:
  - Node.js
  - Express.js
  - MongoDB (via Mongoose)
